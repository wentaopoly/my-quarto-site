Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought\nit over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have\nwondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);\nbut when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-\nPOCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to\nher feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never\nbefore seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to\ntake out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop\ndown a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n\n In another moment down went Alice after it, never once\nconsidering how in the world she was to get out again.\n\n The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,\nand then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a\nmoment to think about stopping herself before she found herself\nfalling down a very deep well.",

How funny it'll seem to come out among the\npeople that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I\nthink--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this\ntime, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall\nhave to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.\nPlease, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried\nto curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling\nthrough the air! Do you think you could manage it?) `And what\nan ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!

And here Alice began to get\nrather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of\nway, `Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do\nbats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either\nquestion, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she\nwas walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very\nearnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a\nbat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of\nsticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\n\n Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a\nmoment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her\nwas another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in\nsight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost:\naway went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it\nsay, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late\nit's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the\ncorner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps\nhanging from the roof.\n\n There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;\nand when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the\nother, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,\nwondering how she was ever to get out again.\n\n Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of\nsolid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,\nand Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the\ndoors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or\nthe key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of\nthem. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low\ncurtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little\ndoor about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key\nin the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!",

Oh! won't she\nbe savage if I've kept her waiting!' Alice felt so desperate\nthat she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit\ncame near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,\nsir--' The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid\ngloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard\nas he could go.\n\n Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very\nhot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:\n`Dear, dear!

Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,\nand--oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the\nthings I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve,\nand four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear!\nI shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the\nMultiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.\nLondon is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,\nand Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been\nchanged for Mabel! I'll try and say \"How doth the little--\"'\nand she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons,\nand began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and\nstrange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--\n\n `How doth the little crocodile\n Improve his shining tail,\n And pour the waters of the Nile\n On every golden scale!",

She got up\nand went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,\nas nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,\nand was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the\ncause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it\nhastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\n\n`That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at\nthe sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in\nexistence; `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed\nback to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut\nagain, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as\nbefore, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child,\n`for I never was so small as this before, never!

Her first\nidea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that\ncase I can go back by railway,' she said to herself. (Alice had\nbeen to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general\nconclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find\na number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in\nthe sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and\nbehind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that\nshe was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine\nfeet high.\n\n `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about,\ntrying to find her way out. `I shall be punished for it now, I\nsuppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer\nthing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.'\n\n Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a\nlittle way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at\nfirst she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then\nshe remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that\nit was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.\n\n `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, `to speak to this\nmouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should\nthink very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in\ntrying.' So she began: `O Mouse, do you know the way out of\nthis pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'\n(Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:\nshe had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having\nseen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to a\nmouse--a mouse--O mouse!') The Mouse looked at her rather\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little\neyes, but it said nothing.\n\n `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; `I\ndaresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the\nConqueror.' (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had\nno very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she\nbegan again: `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in\nher French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the\nwater, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. `Oh, I beg\nyour pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the\npoor animal's feelings. `I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'",

And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah:\nI think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.\nShe is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself,\nas she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so\nnicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and\nshe is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital\none for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again,\nfor this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt\ncertain it must be really offended. `We won't talk about her any\nmore if you'd rather not.'\n\n `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end\nof his tail. `As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family\nalways HATED cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear\nthe name again!'\n\n `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the\nsubject of conversation. `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'\nThe Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: `There is\nsuch a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!\nA little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly\nbrown hair! And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and\nit'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I\ncan't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you\nknow, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!\nHe says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a\nsorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the\nMouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and\nmaking quite a commotion in the pool as it went.\n\n So she called softly after it, `Mouse dear! Do come back\nagain, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't\nlike them!' When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam\nslowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice\nthought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to\nthe shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll\nunderstand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'\n\n It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded\nwith the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a\nDuck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious\ncreatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the\nshore.\n\n CHAPTER III",

And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile:\nsome of the other birds tittered audibly.\n\n `What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone,\n`was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'\n\n `What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much\nto know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY\nought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\n\n `Why,' said the Dodo, `the best way to explain it is to do it.'\n(And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter\nday, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)\n\n First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (`the\nexact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party\nwere placed along the course, here and there. There was no `One,\ntwo, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked,\nand left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know\nwhen the race was over. However, when they had been running half\nan hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called\nout `The race is over!' and they all crowded round it, panting,\nand asking, `But who has won?'\n\n This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\nthought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon\nits forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare,\nin the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At\nlast the Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must have\nprizes.'\n\n `But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices\nasked.\n\n `Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with\none finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her,\ncalling out in a confused way, `Prizes! Prizes!'\n\n Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand\nin her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt\nwater had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.\nThere was exactly one a-piece all round.\n\n `But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.\n\n `Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. `What else have\nyou got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.",

However, it was over at last, and they sat down again\nin a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.\n\n `You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice,\n`and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half\nafraid that it would be offended again.\n\n `Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to\nAlice, and sighing.\n\n `It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with\nwonder at the Mouse's tail; `but why do you call it sad?' And\nshe kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so\nthat her idea of the tale was something like this:--\n\n `Fury said to a\n mouse, That he\n met in the\n house,\n \"Let us\n both go to\n law: I will\n prosecute\n YOU. --Come,\n I'll take no\n denial; We\n must have a\n trial: For\n really this\n morning I've\n nothing\n to do.\"\n Said the\n mouse to the\n cur, \"Such\n a trial,\n dear Sir,\n With\n no jury\n or judge,\n would be\n wasting\n our\n breath.\"\n \"I'll be\n judge, I'll\n be jury,\"\n Said\n cunning\n old Fury:\n \"I'll\n try the\n whole\n cause,\n and\n condemn\n you\n to\n death.\"'\n\n `You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely.\n`What are you thinking of?'\n\n `I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly: `you had got to\nthe fifth bend, I think?'\n\n `I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.\n\n `A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and\nlooking anxiously about her. `Oh, do let me help to undo it!'\n\n `I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up\nand walking away. `You insult me by talking such nonsense!'\n\n `I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice. `But you're so easily\noffended, you know!'\n\n The Mouse only growled in reply.",

And she's such a capital one for\ncatching mice you can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her\nafter the birds! Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look\nat it!'\n\n This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.\nSome of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began\nwrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be\ngetting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary\ncalled out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my\ndears! It's high time you were all in bed!'

Oh, my dear Dinah! I\nwonder if I shall ever see you any more!' And here poor Alice\nbegan to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.\nIn a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of\nfootsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping\nthat the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to\nfinish his story.\n\n CHAPTER IV\n\n The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill",

There was no label this time with the words `DRINK ME,'\nbut nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. `I know\nSOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself,\n`whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this\nbottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for\nreally I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'\n\n It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:\nbefore she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing\nagainst the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being\nbroken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself\n`That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I\ncan't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so\nmuch!'\n\n Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and\ngrowing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in\nanother minute there was not even room for this, and she tried\nthe effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the\nother arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and,\nas a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one\nfoot up the chimney, and said to herself `Now I can do no more,\nwhatever happens. What WILL become of me?'\n\n Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full\neffect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable,\nand, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting\nout of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n\n `It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, `when one\nwasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about\nby mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that\nrabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know,\nthis sort of life! I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!\nWhen I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing\nnever happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There\nought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when\nI grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a\nsorrowful tone; `at least there's no room to grow up any more\nHERE.'",

Mary Ann!' said the voice. `Fetch me my gloves\nthis moment!' Then came a little pattering of feet on the\nstairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and\nshe trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she\nwas now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no\nreason to be afraid of it.\n\n Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;\nbut, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed\nhard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it\nsay to itself `Then I'll go round and get in at the window.'\n\n `THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she\nfancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly\nspread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not\nget hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall,\nand a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was\njust possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something\nof the sort.\n\n Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat! Pat! Where are\nyou?' And then a voice she had never heard before, `Sure then\nI'm here! Digging for apples, yer honour!'\n\n `Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. `Here!\nCome and help me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.)\n\n `Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'\n\n `Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it `arrum.')\n\n `An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it\nfills the whole window!'\n\n `Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'\n\n `Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it\naway!'",

After a minute or two, they\nbegan moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A\nbarrowful will do, to begin with.'\n\n `A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to\ndoubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came\nrattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.\n`I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out,\n`You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead\nsilence.\n\n Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all\nturning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright\nidea came into her head. `If I eat one of these cakes,' she\nthought, `it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it\ncan't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I\nsuppose.'\n\n So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find\nthat she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small\nenough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and\nfound quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.\nThe poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by\ntwo guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.\nThey all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she\nran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a\nthick wood.\n\n `The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she\nwandered about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;\nand the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.\nI think that will be the best plan.'\n\n It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and\nsimply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the\nsmallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering\nabout anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over\nher head made her look up in a great hurry.\n\n An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round\neyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.\n`Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried\nhard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the\ntime at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it\nwould be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.",

Oh\ndear! I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again! Let\nme see--how IS it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or\ndrink something or other; but the great question is, what?'\n\n The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round\nher at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see\nanything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under\nthe circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her,\nabout the same height as herself; and when she had looked under\nit, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her\nthat she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.\n\n She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of\nthe mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large\ncaterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded,\nquietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice\nof her or of anything else.\n\n CHAPTER V\n\n Advice from a Caterpillar",

Alice\nreplied, rather shyly, `I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--\nat least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think\nI must have been changed several times since then.'\n\n `What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly.\n`Explain yourself!'\n\n `I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, `because\nI'm not myself, you see.'\n\n `I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.\n\n `I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very\npolitely, `for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and\nbeing so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.'\n\n `It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.\n\n `Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; `but\nwhen you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you\nknow--and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll\nfeel it a little queer, won't you?'\n\n `Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.\n\n `Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice;\n`all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.'\n\n `You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously. `Who are YOU?'\n\n Which brought them back again to the beginning of the\nconversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's\nmaking such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said,\nvery gravely, `I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'\n\n `Why?' said the Caterpillar.\n\n Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not\nthink of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in\na VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.\n\n `Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her. `I've something\nimportant to say!'\n\n This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back\nagain.\n\n `Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.\n\n `Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as\nshe could.\n\n `No,' said the Caterpillar.\n\n Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else\nto do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth\nhearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but\nat last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth\nagain, and said, `So you think you're changed, do you?'",

There's no pleasing them!'\n\n Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no\nuse in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\n\n `As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the\nPigeon; `but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and\nday! Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'\n\n `I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was\nbeginning to see its meaning.\n\n `And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued\nthe Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, `and just as I was\nthinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come\nwriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!'\n\n `But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice. `I'm a--I'm\na--'\n\n `Well! WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon. `I can see you're\ntrying to invent something!'\n\n `I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she\nremembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.",

Alice crouched down among the\ntrees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled\namong the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and\nuntwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the\npieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very\ncarefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and\ngrowing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had\nsucceeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\n\n It was so long since she had been anything near the right size,\nthat it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a\nfew minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. `Come,\nthere's half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes\nare! I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to\nanother! However, I've got back to my right size: the next\nthing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be\ndone, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an\nopen place, with a little house in it about four feet high.\n`Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, `it'll never do to come\nupon them THIS size: why, I should frighten them out of their\nwits!' So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did\nnot venture to go near the house till she had brought herself\ndown to nine inches high.\n\n CHAPTER VI\n\n Pig and Pepper",

It was opened by another footman in livery,\nwith a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen,\nAlice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their\nheads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and\ncrept a little way out of the wood to listen.\n\n The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great\nletter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to\nthe other, saying, in a solemn tone, `For the Duchess. An\ninvitation from the Queen to play croquet.' The Frog-Footman\nrepeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the\nwords a little, `From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess\nto play croquet.'\n\n Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled\ntogether.\n\n Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into\nthe wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped\nout the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the\nground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.\n\n Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\n\n `There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, `and\nthat for two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the\ndoor as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise\ninside, no one could possibly hear you.' And certainly there was\na most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling\nand sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish\nor kettle had been broken to pieces.\n\n `Please, then,' said Alice, `how am I to get in?'\n\n `There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went\non without attending to her, `if we had the door between us. For\ninstance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let\nyou out, you know.' He was looking up into the sky all the time\nhe was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. `But\nperhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; `his eyes are so\nVERY nearly at the top of his head. But at any rate he might\nanswer questions.--How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud.\n\n `I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, `till tomorrow--'",

It's enough to drive one crazy!'\n\n The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for\nrepeating his remark, with variations. `I shall sit here,' he\nsaid, `on and off, for days and days.'\n\n `But what am I to do?' said Alice.\n\n `Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.\n\n `Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately:\n`he's perfectly idiotic!' And she opened the door and went in.\n\n The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of\nsmoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a\nthree-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was\nleaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to\nbe full of soup.\n\n `There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to\nherself, as well as she could for sneezing.\n\n There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the\nDuchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was\nsneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause. The\nonly things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook,\nand a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from\near to ear.\n\n `Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for\nshe was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to\nspeak first, `why your cat grins like that?'\n\n `It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, `and that's why. Pig!'\n\n She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice\nquite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed\nto the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on\nagain:--\n\n `I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I\ndidn't know that cats COULD grin.'\n\n `They all can,' said the Duchess; `and most of 'em do.'\n\n `I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely,\nfeeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.\n\n `You don't know much,' said the Duchess; `and that's a fact.'",

While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took\nthe cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work\nthrowing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby\n--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,\nplates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them even when\nthey hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it\nwas quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\n\n `Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up\nand down in an agony of terror. `Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS\nnose'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very\nnearly carried it off.\n\n `If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a\nhoarse growl, `the world would go round a deal faster than it\ndoes.'\n\n `Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very\nglad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her\nknowledge. `Just think of what work it would make with the day\nand night! You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn\nround on its axis--'\n\n `Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, `chop off her head!'\n\n Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant\nto take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and\nseemed not to be listening, so she went on again: `Twenty-four\nhours, I THINK; or is it twelve? I--'\n\n `Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; `I never could abide\nfigures!'

Mind now!' The poor little thing sobbed again (or\ngrunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for\nsome while in silence.\n\n Alice was just beginning to think to herself, `Now, what am I\nto do with this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted\nagain, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some\nalarm. This time there could be NO mistake about it: it was\nneither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be\nquite absurd for her to carry it further.",

It looked good-\nnatured, she thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great\nmany teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.\n\n `Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at\nall know whether it would like the name: however, it only\ngrinned a little wider. `Come, it's pleased so far,' thought\nAlice, and she went on. `Would you tell me, please, which way I\nought to go from here?'\n\n `That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said\nthe Cat.\n\n `I don't much care where--' said Alice.\n\n `Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.\n\n `--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.\n\n `Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, `if you only walk\nlong enough.'\n\n Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another\nquestion. `What sort of people live about here?'\n\n `In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round,\n`lives a Hatter: and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw,\n`lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.'\n\n `But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.\n\n `Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: `we're all mad here.\nI'm mad. You're mad.'\n\n `How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.\n\n `You must be,' said the Cat, `or you wouldn't have come here.'\n\n Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on\n`And how do you know that you're mad?'\n\n `To begin with,' said the Cat, `a dog's not mad. You grant\nthat?'\n\n `I suppose so,' said Alice.\n\n `Well, then,' the Cat went on, `you see, a dog growls when it's\nangry, and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm\npleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'\n\n `I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.\n\n `Call it what you like,' said the Cat. `Do you play croquet\nwith the Queen to-day?'\n\n `I should like it very much,' said Alice, `but I haven't been\ninvited yet.'",

As she said\nthis, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a\nbranch of a tree.\n\n `Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.\n\n `I said pig,' replied Alice; `and I wish you wouldn't keep\nappearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.'\n\n `All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,\nbeginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin,\nwhich remained some time after the rest of it had gone.\n\n `Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice;\n`but a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever\nsaw in my life!'\n\n She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the\nhouse of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house,\nbecause the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was\nthatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not\nlike to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand\nbit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even\nthen she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself\n`Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I'd\ngone to see the Hatter instead!'\n\n CHAPTER VII\n\n A Mad Tea-Party\n\n There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house,\nand the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a\nDormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two\nwere using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking\nover its head. `Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice;\n`only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.'",

The Hatter's remark seemed to\nhave no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.\n`I don't quite understand you,' she said, as politely as she\ncould.\n\n `The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured\na little hot tea upon its nose.\n\n The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without\nopening its eyes, `Of course, of course; just what I was going to\nremark myself.'\n\n `Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to\nAlice again.\n\n `No, I give it up,' Alice replied: `what's the answer?'\n\n `I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.\n\n `Nor I,' said the March Hare.\n\n Alice sighed wearily. `I think you might do something better\nwith the time,' she said, `than waste it in asking riddles that\nhave no answers.'\n\n `If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, `you\nwouldn't talk about wasting IT. It's HIM.'\n\n `I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.\n\n `Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head\ncontemptuously. `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'\n\n `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: `but I know I have to\nbeat time when I learn music.'",

Alice asked.\n\n The Hatter shook his head mournfully. `Not I!' he replied.\n`We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--'\n(pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) `--it was at the\ngreat concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\n\n \"Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\n How I wonder what you're at!\"\n\nYou know the song, perhaps?'\n\n `I've heard something like it,' said Alice.\n\n `It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, `in this way:--\n\n \"Up above the world you fly,\n Like a tea-tray in the sky.\n Twinkle, twinkle--\"'\n\nHere the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep\n`Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that\nthey had to pinch it to make it stop.\n\n `Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter,\n`when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, \"He's murdering the\ntime! Off with his head!\"'\n\n `How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.\n\n `And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone,\n`he won't do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.'\n\n A bright idea came into Alice's head. `Is that the reason so\nmany tea-things are put out here?' she asked.\n\n `Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: `it's always\ntea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'\n\n `Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.\n\n `Exactly so,' said the Hatter: `as the things get used up.'\n\n `But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice\nventured to ask.\n\n `Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted,\nyawning. `I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady\ntells us a story.'\n\n `I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at\nthe proposal.\n\n `Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried. `Wake up,\nDormouse!'

Alice thought this a very curious\nthing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up\nto them she heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five!

Two began in a\nlow voice, `Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to\nhave been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;\nand if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads\ncut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore\nshe comes, to--' At this moment Five, who had been anxiously\nlooking across the garden, called out `The Queen!

After these came the royal children; there were\nten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand\nin hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next\ncame the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice\nrecognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous\nmanner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without\nnoticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the\nKing's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\ngrand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\n\n Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on\nher face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember\never having heard of such a rule at processions; `and besides,\nwhat would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if people\nhad all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see it?'\nSo she stood still where she was, and waited.\n\n When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped\nand looked at her, and the Queen said severely `Who is this?'\nShe said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\n\n `Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and,\nturning to Alice, she went on, `What's your name, child?'\n\n `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very\npolitely; but she added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack of\ncards, after all. I needn't be afraid of them!'\n\n `And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three\ngardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as\nthey were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs\nwas the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether\nthey were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her\nown children.\n\n `How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.\n`It's no business of MINE.'\n\n The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her\nfor a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!\nOff--'\n\n `Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the\nQueen was silent.\n\n The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said\n`Consider, my dear: she is only a child!'\n\n The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave\n`Turn them over!'",

So she went in search of her hedgehog.\n\n The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,\nwhich seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one\nof them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her\nflamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where\nAlice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up\ninto a tree.\n\n By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back,\nthe fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight:\n`but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, `as all the arches\nare gone from this side of the ground.' So she tucked it away\nunder her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for\na little more conversation with her friend.\n\n When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to\nfind quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute\ngoing on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who\nwere all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent,\nand looked very uncomfortable.\n\n The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to\nsettle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her,\nthough, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed\nto make out exactly what they said.\n\n The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a\nhead unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had\nnever had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin\nat HIS time of life.\n\n The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be\nbeheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.\n\n The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about\nit in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round.\n(It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so\ngrave and anxious.)\n\n Alice could think of nothing else to say but `It belongs to the\nDuchess: you'd better ask HER about it.'\n\n `She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner: `fetch\nher here.' And the executioner went off like an arrow.",

Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper that\nmakes people hot-tempered,' she went on, very much pleased at\nhaving found out a new kind of rule, `and vinegar that makes them\nsour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar\nand such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish\npeople knew that: then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you\nknow--'\n\n She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a\nlittle startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.\n`You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you\nforget to talk. I can't tell you just now what the moral of that\nis, but I shall remember it in a bit.'\n\n `Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.\n\n `Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess. `Everything's got a\nmoral, if only you can find it.' And she squeezed herself up\ncloser to Alice's side as she spoke.\n\n Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first,\nbecause the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was\nexactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder,\nand it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not\nlike to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.\n\n `The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of\nkeeping up the conversation a little.\n\n `'Tis so,' said the Duchess: `and the moral of that is--\"Oh,\n'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round!\"'\n\n `Somebody said,' Alice whispered, `that it's done by everybody\nminding their own business!'",

Alice did not quite like\nthe look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would\nbe quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage\nQueen: so she waited.\n\n The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the\nQueen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled. `What fun!'\nsaid the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.\n\n `What IS the fun?' said Alice.\n\n `Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon. `It's all her fancy, that: they\nnever executes nobody, you know. Come on!'\n\n `Everybody says \"come on!\" here,' thought Alice, as she went\nslowly after it: `I never was so ordered about in all my life,\nnever!'\n\n They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the\ndistance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,\nas they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart\nwould break. She pitied him deeply. `What is his sorrow?' she\nasked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the\nsame words as before, `It's all his fancy, that: he hasn't got\nno sorrow, you know. Come on!'\n\n So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with\nlarge eyes full of tears, but said nothing.\n\n `This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, `she wants for to\nknow your history, she do.'\n\n `I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow\ntone: `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've\nfinished.'\n\n So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice\nthought to herself, `I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he\ndoesn't begin.' But she waited patiently.\n\n `Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `I was\na real Turtle.'\n\n These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only\nby an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and\nthe constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very\nnearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your\ninteresting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be\nmore to come, so she sat still and said nothing.",

And the Gryphon never learnt it.'\n\n `Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: `I went to the Classics\nmaster, though. He was an old crab, HE was.'\n\n `I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: `he\ntaught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'\n\n `So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn;\nand both creatures hid their faces in their paws.\n\n `And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a\nhurry to change the subject.\n\n `Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: `nine the\nnext, and so on.'\n\n `What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.\n\n `That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon\nremarked: `because they lessen from day to day.'\n\n This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a\nlittle before she made her next remark. `Then the eleventh day\nmust have been a holiday?'\n\n `Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.\n\n `And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.\n\n `That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a\nvery decided tone: `tell her something about the games now.'\n\n CHAPTER X\n\n The Lobster Quadrille\n\n The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper\nacross his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for\na minute or two sobs choked his voice. `Same as if he had a bone\nin his throat,' said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him\nand punching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered\nhis voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on\nagain:--\n\n `You may not have lived much under the sea--' (`I haven't,' said Alice)--\n`and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--'\n(Alice began to say `I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily,\nand said `No, never') `--so you can have no idea what a delightful\nthing a Lobster Quadrille is!'\n\n `No, indeed,' said Alice. `What sort of a dance is it?'\n\n `Why,' said the Gryphon, `you first form into a line along the sea-shore--'\n\n `Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle. `Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;\nthen, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--'",

But they HAVE their tails\nin their mouths; and the reason is--' here the Mock Turtle\nyawned and shut his eyes.--`Tell her about the reason and all\nthat,' he said to the Gryphon.\n\n `The reason is,' said the Gryphon, `that they WOULD go with\nthe lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So\nthey had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in\ntheir mouths. So they couldn't get them out again. That's all.'\n\n `Thank you,' said Alice, `it's very interesting. I never knew\nso much about a whiting before.'\n\n `I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the\nGryphon. `Do you know why it's called a whiting?'\n\n `I never thought about it,' said Alice. `Why?'\n\n `IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very\nsolemnly.\n\n Alice was thoroughly puzzled. `Does the boots and shoes!' she\nrepeated in a wondering tone.\n\n `Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon. `I\nmean, what makes them so shiny?'\n\n Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she\ngave her answer. `They're done with blacking, I believe.'\n\n `Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep\nvoice, `are done with a whiting. Now you know.'\n\n `And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great\ncuriosity.\n\n `Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather\nimpatiently: `any shrimp could have told you that.'",

And the Gryphon added `Come, let's hear some of YOUR\nadventures.'\n\n `I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,'\nsaid Alice a little timidly: `but it's no use going back to\nyesterday, because I was a different person then.'\n\n `Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle.\n\n `No, no! The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an\nimpatient tone: `explanations take such a dreadful time.'\n\n So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when\nshe first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about\nit just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on\neach side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she\ngained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly\nquiet till she got to the part about her repeating `YOU ARE OLD,\nFATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming\ndifferent, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said\n`That's very curious.'\n\n `It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.\n\n `It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated\nthoughtfully. `I should like to hear her try and repeat\nsomething now. Tell her to begin.' He looked at the Gryphon as\nif he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.\n\n `Stand up and repeat \"'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,\"' said\nthe Gryphon.\n\n `How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat\nlessons!' thought Alice; `I might as well be at school at once.'\nHowever, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so\nfull of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was\nsaying, and the words came very queer indeed:--\n\n `'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\n \"You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.\"\n As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\n Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.'",

In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large\ndish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice\nquite hungry to look at them--`I wish they'd get the trial done,'\nshe thought, `and hand round the refreshments!' But there seemed\nto be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about\nher, to pass away the time.\n\n Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had\nread about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that\nshe knew the name of nearly everything there. `That's the\njudge,' she said to herself, `because of his great wig.'\n\n The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown\nover the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he\ndid it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly\nnot becoming.",

However, `jury-men' would have done just\nas well.\n\n The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.\n`What are they doing?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. `They\ncan't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's begun.'\n\n `They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in\nreply, `for fear they should forget them before the end of the\ntrial.'\n\n `Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but\nshe stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, `Silence in\nthe court!' and the King put on his spectacles and looked\nanxiously round, to make out who was talking.\n\n Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their\nshoulders, that all the jurors were writing down `stupid things!'\non their slates, and she could even make out that one of them\ndidn't know how to spell `stupid,' and that he had to ask his\nneighbour to tell him. `A nice muddle their slates'll be in\nbefore the trial's over!' thought Alice.\n\n One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course,\nAlice could not stand, and she went round the court and got\nbehind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it\naway. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was\nBill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of\nit; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write\nwith one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very\nlittle use, as it left no mark on the slate.\n\n `Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.\n\n On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and\nthen unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--\n\n `The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\n All on a summer day:\n The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,\n And took them quite away!'\n\n `Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.\n\n `Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. `There's\na great deal to come before that!'\n\n `Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit\nblew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, `First\nwitness!'",

I'm a hatter.'\n\n Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the\nHatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.\n\n `Give your evidence,' said the King; `and don't be nervous, or\nI'll have you executed on the spot.'\n\n This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept\nshifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the\nQueen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his\nteacup instead of the bread-and-butter.\n\n Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which\npuzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was\nbeginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she\nwould get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she\ndecided to remain where she was as long as there was room for\nher.\n\n `I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was\nsitting next to her. `I can hardly breathe.'\n\n `I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly: `I'm growing.'\n\n `You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.\n\n `Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: `you know\nyou're growing too.'\n\n `Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse:\n`not in that ridiculous fashion.' And he got up very sulkily\nand crossed over to the other side of the court.",

Go on!'\n\n `I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, `and most things\ntwinkled after that--only the March Hare said--'\n\n `I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\n\n `You did!' said the Hatter.\n\n `I deny it!' said the March Hare.\n\n `He denies it,' said the King: `leave out that part.'\n\n `Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on,\nlooking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the\nDormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.\n\n `After that,' continued the Hatter, `I cut some more bread-\nand-butter--'\n\n `But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.\n\n `That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.\n\n `You MUST remember,' remarked the King, `or I'll have you\nexecuted.'\n\n The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter,\nand went down on one knee. `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he\nbegan.\n\n `You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.\n\n Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately\nsuppressed by the officers of the court. (As that is rather a\nhard word, I will just explain to you how it was done. They had\na large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings:\ninto this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat\nupon it.)\n\n `I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. `I've so often\nread in the newspapers, at the end of trials, \"There was some\nattempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the\nofficers of the court,\" and I never understood what it meant\ntill now.'\n\n `If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,'\ncontinued the King.\n\n `I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter: `I'm on the floor, as\nit is.'\n\n `Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.",

She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that\nit signifies much,' she said to herself; `I should think it\nwould be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'\n\n As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of\nbeing upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and\nhanded back to them, they set to work very diligently to write\nout a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed\ntoo much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,\ngazing up into the roof of the court.\n\n `What do you know about this business?' the King said to\nAlice.\n\n `Nothing,' said Alice.\n\n `Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.\n\n `Nothing whatever,' said Alice.\n\n `That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.\nThey were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when\nthe White Rabbit interrupted: `UNimportant, your Majesty means,\nof course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and\nmaking faces at him as he spoke.\n\n `UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and\nwent on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant--\nunimportant--important--' as if he were trying which word\nsounded best.\n\n Some of the jury wrote it down `important,' and some\n`unimportant.'

ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE\nHIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'\n\n Everybody looked at Alice.\n\n `I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.\n\n `You are,' said the King.\n\n `Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.\n\n `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: `besides,\nthat's not a regular rule: you invented it just now.'\n\n `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.\n\n `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.\n\n The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.\n`Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling\nvoice.\n\n `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said\nthe White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has\njust been picked up.'\n\n `What's in it?' said the Queen.\n\n `I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, `but it seems\nto be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'\n\n `It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was\nwritten to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'\n\n `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.\n\n `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,\nthere's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.' He unfolded the paper\nas he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set\nof verses.'\n\n `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of\nthe jurymen.\n\n `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the\nqueerest thing about it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.)\n\n `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.\n(The jury all brightened up again.)\n\n `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and\nthey can't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.'\n\n `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the\nmatter worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd\nhave signed your name like an honest man.'\n\n There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the\nfirst really clever thing the King had said that day.\n\n `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.\n\n `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. `Why, you don't\neven know what they're about!'\n\n `Read them,' said the King.\n\n The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. `Where shall I begin,\nplease your Majesty?' he asked.\n\n `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on\ntill you come to the end: then stop.'\n\n These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--",
